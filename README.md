## Print an Envelope, with a company logo\.


</div>

### Description

This can print with envelopes, it also prints a company logo with it.

Very simple all you have to do is along the lines of this:

frmPrint.Logo = "c:\...."

frmPrint.City = "New York"

[blah....]

frmPrint.Line1 = "17"

frmPrint.Init

And that's that, up comes a useful little form that says its printing an envelope and it has a progress bar and its modal and everything. PLEASE VOTE... this took me ages to get this to work.
